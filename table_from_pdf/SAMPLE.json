Information about how samples and sub samples are\rrelated to each other is captured in SAMPLE ORIGIN.", "74": "TOP MEASURED DEPTH: The top or upper depth from which this sample was\rcollected. This depth is used as the upper limit in the total length of the sample.", "75": "TOP MEASURED DEPTH ORIGINAL UNIT OF MEASURE: The original unit of\rmeasure used for the top depth. Common units are meters or feet.", "76": "TOP STRATIGRAPHY UNIT IDENTIFIER: A unique identifier for a stratigraphy unit\rat the top of the well.", "77": "TOTAL LENGTH: The total length is the length of the entire sample before the\rrepresentative sample is procured from it. The representative sample data is\rcollected as the INITIAL_LENGTH. In well coring, the TOTAL_LENGTH is the length\rof the core from the based depth to the top depth. In this case the total length can be\rvery long. The INITIAL_LENGTH is the length of the samples that are removed at the\rsample intervals. These are analyzed or stored.", "78": "TOTAL LENGTH ORIGINAL UNIT OF MEASURE: The original unit of measure used\rfor the total sample length. Common units are meters or feet.", "79": "TOTAL VOLUME: The total volume is the volume of the entire sample before the\rrepresentative sample is procured from it. The representative sample data is\rcollected as the INITIAL_VOLUME. In liquid sampling, the TOTAL_VOLUME is the\rvolume of the entire extracted fluid. In this case the total volume can be very large.\rThe INITIAL_VOLUME is the volume of the samples that are removed at the sample\rintervals. These are analyzed or stored.", "80": "TOTAL VOLUME ORIGINAL UNIT OF MEASURE: The original unit of measure used\rfor the total sample volume. Common units are m^3, L or mL.", "81": "TOTAL WEIGHT: The total weight is the weight of the entire sample before the\rrepresentative sample is procured from it. The representative sample data is\rcollected as the INITIAL_WEIGHT. In well coring, the TOTAL_WEIGHT is the weight\rof the core from the base depth to the top depth. In this case the total weight can be\rvery heavy. The INITIAL_WEIGHT is the weight of the samples that are removed at\rthe sample intervals.", "82": "ORIGINAL UNIT OF MEASURE", "83": "WELL DATUM TYPE: Identifies the various type of well datums that may be used as\relevation reference datums. For example kelly bushing, ground, derrick floor, casing\rflange or sea level.", "84": "ROW CHANGED BY: Application login id of the user who last changed the row.", "85": "ROW CHANGED DATE: System date of the last time the row was changed.", "86": "ROW CREATED BY: System user who created this row of data.", "87": "ROW CREATED DATE: Date that the row was created on.", "88": "ROW_EFFECTIVE_DATE: A system assigned date that specified when a row of data\ris effective from a systems perspective. This may be the date that a row of data was\rmade available to end users, for example.", "89": "ROW_EXPIRY_DATE: A system assigned date that specified when a row of data is\rno longer effective from a systems perspective. This may be the date that a row of\rdata was no longer available to end users, for example.", "90": "PPDM ROW QUALITY: A set of values indicating the quality of data in this row,\rusually with reference to the method or procedures used to load the data, although\rother types of quality reference are permitted."}}}
