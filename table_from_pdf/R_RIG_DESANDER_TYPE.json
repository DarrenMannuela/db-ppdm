The desander should be located downstream of the shale\rshakers and degassers, but before the desilters or mud cleaners. A volume of mud is\rpumped into the wide upper section of the hydrocylone at an angle roughly tangent to\rits circumference. As the mud flows around and gradually down the inside of the\rcone shape, solids are separated from the liquid by centrifugal forces. The solids\rcontinue around and down until they exit the bottom of the hydrocyclone (along with\rsmall amounts of liquid) and are discarded. The cleaner and lighter density liquid\rmud travels up through a vortex in the center of the hydrocyclone, exits through\rpiping at the top of the hydrocyclone and is then routed to the mud tanks and the next\rmud-cleaning device, usually a desilter. Various size desander and desilter cones are\rfunctionally identical, with the size of the cone determining the size of particles the\rdevice removes from the mud system.
